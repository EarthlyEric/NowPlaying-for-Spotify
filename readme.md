## **How to host this?**

You can use XAMPP (multi-platform) or Wampserver (Windows only) but any webserver with PHP 7.0 or greater is good to use, with the `php-curl`Â module.

**!!! If you are on Nginx you need to add this to your config, or else your .env will be exposed to the internet !!!**
```
location /.env {
    allow [YourIP]; # Allow your IP if you want to, if not delete this line.
    deny all;
}
```

## **What modifications are required?**

You should have a declared app in Spotify's developer dashboard to obtain a `Client ID`.

*How to do this:*
As I said, the first thing is to create a Client ID (`Create a Client ID` button) on [Spotify's developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
Type your app's name in the `App or Hardware name` text field, and its description on the `App or Hardware description` text field. In the `What are you building ?` section, indicate the platform which you are building the app for, then click on the `NEXT` button. Answer to the commercial integration question, and continue. If necessary, fill the form and check all the boxes at the 3rd stage and you're ready to go. Your app is declared in Spotify's developer dashboard!

Now that you have your app, you have some modifications to do in one file: `.env`.
(If it doesn't exist, copy `example.env` to `.env`)

Edit those values:

- `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` by your Client ID available on your app's panel,
- `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` by your `Client Secret` available by clicking on the `Show Client Secret` button situated on the same webpage as your client ID,
- `YOUR_DOMAIN` by your redirect URL, in the case of a local hosting replace it by `http://localhost/token.php` in most cases. Basicaly, it's the accessible URL for the `token.php` page.

Let's go back on our app's panel. You need to declare the URL where the `token.php` page is located, for a local hosting it would be in most cases `http://localhost/token.php`. Click on the green `Edit settings` button situated on the top of the page, then in the `Redirect URIs` text field, indicate yours. ***ATTENTION***: what you typed should **IMPERATIVELY** be the same as what you wrote in the two precedent files! Then click on the `SAVE` button on the very bottom of the form. Your app is declared and ready to use!
